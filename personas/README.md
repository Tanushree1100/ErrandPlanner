# Scenarios
## Sophie
* It is a Wednesday afternoon and Sophie has just got off her Clinical Practice for a quick lunch break. She heads to her car where she usually eats her lunch and takes a few minutes to unwind and relax before returning to the clinic. She usually also takes the time to go through her planner and check if she needs to run an errand. Sophie receives a text from Wilson Printing that her order will be ready to pick up on Friday around the same time.  
* Sophie was finishing up her homework on Friday and she receives a text from her clinical supervisor that they are understaffed on Wednesday and needed Sophie to be available for a longer time on Wednesday than her regular shift hours. Since Sophie usually uses her time after her shifts to run her errands, those now will have to be rescheduled as she will not be free at that time.

## Brendon
### Sibling's birthday
* It’s Brendon’s sibling, Arsene’s birthday and Brendon’s schedule is packed until he gets back home. 
  + He has exactly two gaps in his schedule and wants to use the longer one for eating lunch.
  + He knows that his brother is really into legos
